# ✨ Quote for the day

I often remind myself that instead of trying to claim an identity, it is more meaningful to shape my own.

These quotes are fragments I’ve written down or gathered over time.

I keep them here as a daily reminder of what I value and the person I’m working to become.

<div id="daily-quote"
     style="
       margin-top: 2.8rem;
       padding: 0.8rem 1rem;
       border-left: 4px solid #7c3aed;
       background: rgba(124, 58, 237, 0.08);
       border-radius: 6px;
       transition: opacity .4s ease;
       opacity: 0;
     ">
  <div id="quote-text" style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;"></div>
  <div id="quote-meta" style="opacity: 0.7; display: flex; justify-content: flex-end"></div>
</div>
